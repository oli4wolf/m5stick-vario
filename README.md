# m5stick-vario
The idee is to transfert the vario, which i build based on the m5stack-core2, to m5stick-plus-c.

# Differences
* Removed the sdcard.
* Different algorithm for the beep.

# TODO
[] Modify Platformio for m5stick.
[] Adapt the Pin adresses for the groove connector.
[] Simplify the screen (green, red, black), only m/s and maybe an arrow.
[] Modify the tone generation to the buzzer.
